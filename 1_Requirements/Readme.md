# KEYPAD INTERFACING USING ATMEGA328P
## INTRODUCTION
  * A keypad is a block or pad of buttons set with an arrangement of digits, symbols, or alphabetical letters. Pads mostly containing numbers and used with computers are numeric keypads. Keypads are found on devices which require mainly numeric input such as calculators, television remotes, push-button telephones, vending machines, ATMs, Point of Sale devices, combination locks, and digital door locks.
## OBJECTIVES
  * The main goal of this project is interfacing the keypad LED using Atmega328p.
## SWOT ANALYSIS
### STRENGTH
   * It will make a input as a digital which has been accessed by the computer.
   * It is easier and simple to construct.
   * It can be used in place of an ordinary keyboard.
### WEAKNESS
   * Sometimes digital error can occur.
   * It does not work well of text-based inputs.
   * It have only limited options.
### OPPORTUNITY:
  * To develop user interface.
  * To add more functionalities
### THREATENS:
  * Other applications have better features.
  * Other applications have secured.
