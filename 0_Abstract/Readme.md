# KEYPAD INTERFACING USING ATMEGA328P

Keypad is used as an input device to read the key pressed by the user and to process it. 4x4 keypad consists of 4 rows and 4 columns. Switches are placed between the rows and columns. A key press establishes a connection between the corresponding row and column, between which the switch is placed.How it Works. This 4x4 matrix keypad has 16 built-in pushbutton contacts connected to row and column lines. A microcontroller can scan these lines for a button-pressed state.In the keypad library, the Propeller sets all the column lines to input, and all the row lines to input.Keypads are widely used input devices being used in various electronics and embedded projects. They are used to take inputs in the form of numbers and albhabets, and feed the same into system for further processing.
