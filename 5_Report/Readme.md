# KEYPAD INTERFACING USING ATMEGA 328P
## THEORY
  * Keypad is used as an input device to read the key pressed by the user and to process it. 4x4 keypad consists of 4 rows and 4 columns. Switches are placed between the rows and columns. A key press establishes a connection between the corresponding row and column, between which the switch is placed.How it Works. This 4x4 matrix keypad has 16 built-in pushbutton contacts connected to row and column lines. A microcontroller can scan these lines for a button-pressed state.
## SIMULATION
  * The functionality of the K is coded in embedded c and the working is demonstrated using simuation in a software called SimulIDE.
## 4 W'S AND 1 H:
### WHO : 
   Keypad Interfacing is used majorly by manufacturers of electrical and electronic components.

### WHAT : 
The keypad is used as an input device to read the key pressed by the user and to process it.

### WHERE :
Keypad Interfacing is used in all Elevator Systems, Mobile Phones, Computers, Caluclators, etc.

### WHEN : 
Keypad Interfacing is used while performing calculations, moving between various floors in a multi-story building.

### HOW : 
This is output is determined on the display by using a 4x4 keypad.
## SWOT ANALYSIS
### STRENGTH
   * It will make a input as a digital which has been accessed by the computer.
   * It is easier and simple to construct.
   * It can be used in place of an ordinary keyboard.
### WEAKNESS
   * Sometimes digital error can occur.
   * It does not work well of text-based inputs.
   * It have only limited options.
### OPPORTUNITY:
  * To develop user interface.
  * To add more functionalities
### THREATENS:
  * Other applications have better features.
  * Other applications have secured.
