# KEYPAD INTERFACING USING ATMEGA 328P
## THEORY
  * Keypad is used as an input device to read the key pressed by the user and to process it. 4x4 keypad consists of 4 rows and 4 columns. Switches are placed between the rows and columns. A key press establishes a connection between the corresponding row and column, between which the switch is placed.How it Works. This 4x4 matrix keypad has 16 built-in pushbutton contacts connected to row and column lines. A microcontroller can scan these lines for a button-pressed state.
## SIMULATION
  * The functionality of the K is coded in embedded c and the working is demonstrated using simuation in a software called SimulIDE.
